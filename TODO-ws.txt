Mole Web Service Client and Server TODO

Week of Jan 9:
- using MT vm and Lenovo
- get full loop of scanner daemon + mole-ws working, possibly (should)
  work against a local server; currently getting NPE in server; check
  that json send with daemon's scans is the same as without using this.
  - in process: there is some difference between what 'self-scanning' is sending and what is being sent with the scanner

- improve output of query results through new class
- test accelerometer
- test other components (binder, daemon, cli)
- change simpleScanQueue size back to normal
- create new maemo and linux packages

Future improvements:
- scale/normalize score provided in query results
- shorten time for scanning (do several scans in quick succession)

If desired:
- improve the persistence of the db
- server does pre-screening of containers based on mac union
- use device type to segment scans
